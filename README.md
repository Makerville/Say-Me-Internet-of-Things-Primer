# Say Me - Internet of Things Primer

> _primer_ - any book of elementary principles

Internet of Things or IoT will be playing an important role in our lives. Somewhat similar to the gradual and then fast evolution of personal computers, connected devices have the potential to alter the course of humanity profoundly.

In this book, we are going to take a look at some of the different components that go into building a connected device. Each of the following parts will be a hands-on guide -

### 1 - Blinking an LED

### 2 - MQTT and Shadows

### 3 - Rules as bridges

### 4 - Maps and graphs

---

**YMMV** - This book is meant to introduce the readers to the different moving parts of a connected device. It is by no means a comprehensive guide. As such, the content will be opinionated and we suggest using this book only as a primer.
